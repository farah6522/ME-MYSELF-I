People say, they are way too much in love with my writing, so I wondered...why don't you fall head over heels too? My biggest success right now (I'm going to publish soon. II have a draft) is WINGS: Fantasy. M love Fantasy extends out of the solar system. Let's go through my book drafts that is about to make a change to this world. I mostly use fictional characters such as: Hani, Lina, Cease, Ramzy, Farah and Ecli. These are shortened names of my friends in reality but just remember...the characters in the stories are fictional.

<br>Taerah is an ARMY and is willing to give up anything for Kim Taehyung.....her bias and her long-term crush. It's not really every day you love a celebrity for 4 years. When Taerah meets Taehyung in a fan meet, she was struck with happiness. A happiness that won't come when you just see your celebrity. The happiness you get when you meet the one you love. Taehyung, who is slightly different from his personality on TV, avoids and stays away from Taerah because she is a Muslim. That's when Taerah starts to change. She stops wearing an Abaya and Scarf and starts wearing T-shirts and Tops?! Taehyung notices how she could give up her own religion for her love for him. But you know someone always has to come in the way... Suga, who thinks Taerah is beautiful in her own way falls for her. Even when she changes he can't get him out of his head.  Jennie, who is a girl who liked Taehyung from the first she laid her eyes on him. She will do anything to get Fatima out of her way. Taerah is not Taerah But, Kim Farah. Now all attention goes to her. And Jennie will do anything to make sure Kim Farah never gets in her way. She and her group of 4 friends, whose words are like poison can do anything. But Farah will cope and in many ways....&nbsp;<br></p>

<br>We coincidentally looked into each others eyes. From the stage, to the seats. But obstacles do exist, don't they? There's Jennie. Beautiful girl. I want to cry. Her beauty is too much for me to bear. And it was too much for him too. That's why I saw him trace a finger down her cheeks.

<br>We always looked at each other in the eyes and 
<br>smiled.
<br>Suddenly, one swing was empty
<br>I kicked up higher
<br>Every kick releasing my sorrow
<br>What will you do if I ever leave you?
<br>Why? Why was I so stupid? For not, noticing?
<br>This was the first time I kicked up on a swing.
<br>nothing?
<br>I don't like lies, so I did nothing.
<br>Another kick, then another, then another.
<br>I feel like these swings have no end
<br>Is he watching me??
<br>                                                 The sun reflected on my glasses,
<br>                                          I squinted against the light of the sun
<br>I kicked higher, Higher,higher and higher
<br>These kicks really have no end.
