                        I sat on the bridge, my feet dangling on the edge. I looked at the lake beneath me. The bridge's reflection was beautiful. I ran my hand down the vines of the sakuras. The sakuras are dead, dead petals fell at my touch, describing my state at the moment. I was dead. Feeling less. Blind and mute. Not physically of course. Emotionally. Every word that has been said to me were words of discouragement and hatred. Today was the anniversary of my separation with Hani, Lina and Ecli. I concluded on this day, I can't carry on by myself. They fill me. They are friends. Friends I never had. I looked at the neat pile of diaries in front of me. Each of them had at least 5 things about how much I cared about them. And why they threw me out like rubbish is still a mystery. But I'm a fool and I want them back into my life. Everyone eventually left my life. Hani, Lina,Cease,Ecli, Aeel and my family. Now I'm all alone, in the dark. I smiled as my tears stung my eyes. I know where this was going to head, as tears poured out like an endless stream of water. I looked at the lake again, allowing my tears to mix with the water. At least a part of me is in there. I stood up on the rails of the bridge. The vines prickled my feet. I looked back, through the window and into the restaurant, where there were 4 girls laughing. Hani turned around as she saw a familiar smile as the figure lifted its leg and fell from the railing. The fall was followed with a splash. Hani ran out and looked down, watching the girl she and the others hurt so much, slowly sinking into the lake. She trembled and shook. Tears started busting out. Then she screamed a blood curling scream

<br>Am I the one singing?
<br>2 voices
<br>Me and someone

<br>I look behind

<br>Making its way into my heart

Why am I depressed and lonely? Why do I cut? But 7 lights...I know you'll pull me to heaven. I love you guys,so much. Nobody knows how much. Classmates will say you look like girls. Others will say you're gay. But I want all of you to know that you have good fate ahead of you. Special achievements. You guys rescued me. Brought me to reality. Helped me face the harsh world. It's nice, having 7 lights to guide me to right. It's something to smile about. You're company is with me. Even if you are not present in front of my eyes, you guys are always present in my heart, brain and tongue. You're music saved me. Your voices revived me from the dark. You're word inspired me. Your songs and meanings made me step higher. I took one step by one, followed you as my guide. Fellow ARMYs are there for me. You guys shaped them. I don't need people who hurt and back stab. I have ARMY and they are my family. Bangtan is my family. I feel like that's why I came to the world. To know BTS And ARMY&nbsp;<br></p>

It's so upsetting, watching people trying to push me down but suffering. I keep laughing at their upsetting failure. How much more will they try? They are just wasting energy. Know I can't be beaten. Why? I'm KFY. Girl, who pushes people down instead of letting herself be pushed down...I have 14 people in life that need to be safe. Just 14...my 1st priority. Nothing comes before them. I have to make sure I don't fall until they are safe. Because they are not. Danger runs towards them at the speed of light. Danger...

Shape hearts and dreams with their own hands. They don't need suits like superman or wear their underwear inside out. They are normal humans, who's hands are specialised to shape dream, and their words shape a person's life.It changes, people change. It's surprising how just 7 boys can do so much, they are like fairies or goblins. It's shocking, how they changed me. From Fatima, to Farah. It's beautiful. The metamorphosis. It's bright and beautiful. Just a rope tied around my waste, pulling me to the light. I can see them laughing with me. Jimin giving me an eye smile. Jungkook's bunny smile. Rapmon shaking my hand. V smiling softly with those eyes I always get lost in. Hoseok with his bright self, cheering "another person saved" Jin singing out of happiness. Yoongi, sleeping, whispering "Yes" in his sleep. Is this how they are? Is this how happy they are after saving an ARMY? Smiling? Then how many laughs and smiles do they have in their lives? They must be happy. I smile at them, bowing out of respect. Saying Thank you, with tears in my eyes. And then they'll give me all a hug. They'll do it to every other person who they'll save after me. They'll put the rope down...and pull another girl or boy and they'll wipe their tears away. I smile... Magical...Truly magical.
<br>Gwaenchanayeo Bangtan. Gwaenchana...I'm happy And you are the cause of it...
