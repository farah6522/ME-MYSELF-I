                    A FATE WITH A BAD TWIST</h1>
                <p class="mbr-text align-center display-5 pb-3 mbr-fonts-style">I'm 13, yes. It was too early for a girl to lose their father. It was too early for me. My father was diagnosed with cancer. Doctors said he'd last for 3 months. That was 2013. But prediction is never right. It's a guess. Thank god, my father lived for another 4 years and finally passed away on 21st February 2017. It was night. My family and my uncle was having an islamic gathering we called Ta'leem. I was really sleepy. My father was't there. He was stuck in a hospital bed in the room next to us. After the gatheringfinished, I straight went to my mothers bed and fell asleep. About 20 minutes later, my mother woke me up.<br>"Fatima, your father went away" was what she said. I cried for a real short time, then I thought she was joking. Then I went to see his body. I was shocked even to cry, when I realized what my mother was saying was no joke. My dad was lying in front of me, eyes closed. The doctors from the hospitl came and confirmed that he was no more. And from Dawn, people came to see us. My dad passed away somewhere about 1 o' clock at night. At 11 pm, I pestered my mother to go to school. I know, you'll think I'm a ungrateful being with no feelings. No. I went to school because I needed my friends to comfort me. Yes, the sameones that say I sound depressed and left me after 1 year of friendship. Yes, those beings. I felt much better with them. After school, I came back home, not hanging aroud at schol like I usually did. I found some of my teachers, talking with my mother. I was touched that my teachers also came to see me. This is my story. Please Pray for my father. I still can't believe that I went for comfort to a bunch of betraying beings. Well, the fairytale ends here. The end.</p>
